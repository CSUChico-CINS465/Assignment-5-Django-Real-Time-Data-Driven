## Submitting Assignment 5

You should upload all the project files to a folder called *Assignment_5* in that repository. You will be putting all your assignments for this class in that repository, except your final project which likely will have it's own repository.

You should make sure that your *manage.py* path in the repository is such that it can be reached via *./Assignment_5/manage.py*
